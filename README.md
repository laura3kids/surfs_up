# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Determine trends of the temperature before opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu to decide if the business will be sustainable year round. The analysis is specifically focusing on the months of June and December.

### Results: 

There were 1700 recorded temperatures for June.  Temperatures ranged from a low of 64 degrees to a high of 83 degrees.  The average temperature was 75 degrees with the majority of temperatures ranging from 73-77 degrees.  

There were 1517 recorded temperatures for December.  Temperatures ranged from a low of 56 degrees to a high of 83 degrees.  The average temperature was 71 degrees with the majority of temperatures ranging from 69-74 degrees.

* Average temperatures for June and December were 75 degrees and 71 degrees, respectfully, for only a difference of 4 degrees
* Maximum temperature recorded was the same for June and December at 83 degrees. 
* Minimum temperatures for June and December were 64 and 56 degrees, respectfully, for a difference of 9 degrees. 


### Summary: 

* There wasn't much difference in the range of temperatures between June and December.  The greatest difference occured in the lowest temperatures recorded, which resulted in a difference of December being 9 degrees colder than June.  
* One suggestion to investigate this data further would be to look at the number of times each temperature was recorded in each year rather than by just the month of June or December.  
* Another suggestion would be to run this analysis on all months to determine if these truly are the months that might produce the lowest temperatures.  There may be others that that have more recorded low temperatures.

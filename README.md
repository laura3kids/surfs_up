* 29,414 Senior Engineers will be retiring.  
* 14,222 Engineers and
* 1,761 Assistant Engineers

Additionally, there are:
* 28,254 Senior Staff retiring
* 12,243 Staff members retiring
* 4,502 Technique Leaders retiring and
* 2 Management staff retiring
 

### Summary: 

* Pewlett-Hackard has 300,024 current employees.  90,398 of these employees will be of retirement age in the next three years, resulting in just over 90,000 job vacancies. This is a large amount of vacancies that will need to be filled in the upcoming years.  

* Pewlett-Hackard has a mentorship program that consists of future retirees to mentor the remaining employees.  Those employees included in the program held the same current title as the retiree and had a date of birth from 1/1/1965 - 12/31/1965.  According to the analysis, there would be a very small number (1,549) employees eligible for the program.  This results in a very large ratio of retiree to mentor and in one case, no current employee to mentor.

* By expanding the mentorship program to include the birthdates of current employees to 1/1/1964 - 12/31/1965, this greatly expands those eligible for mentorship and allows for a much more realistic ratio of retirees to mentored employee.
